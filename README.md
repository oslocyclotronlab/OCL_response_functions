This is a collection of various response matrices used at OCL/the nuclear physics group in Oslo.
Files:
- `nai2012_for_opt13`: CACTUS response matrix as remeasured 2012
- `oscar2017_scale1.15`: OSCAR response from the simulations in 2017, where the cmp. part is scaled up by 1.15 to get a better match with the (analoge) in-beam spectra
- `nai2012_alternative_format.zip`: CACTUS response, as above, `nai2012_for_opt13` but in zip format
  
Further files:
- `test_response_interpolation_cactus.py`: Some test, not sure what it does
